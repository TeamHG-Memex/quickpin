This page allows you to view the results of your various crawls.
The x's and check marks in each pin allow you to mark interest or disinterest in a webpage.
This will help to train the crawler and provide scores to these websites.
If some results on this page are not scored (a pin will have a 'score' field once scoring has taken place),
that is because scoring must be triggered by the user whenever webpages are added to the system.
But don't worry, it's really easy, just train the crawler by clicking x's and checks,
then head on over to the Score Results link in the navigation bar.
